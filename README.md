# qa-automation-challenge

This repository includes files as a response to the qa-automation-challenge/framework-level.

The  file MariaMendesViana-ProductSubscription-ErrorReport.docx is the report that resulted from the exploratory tests to the portal https://qa-automation-challenge.github.io/sandbox/.
The TC001 to TC004 files are the simulation to feature files for testing the acceptance criteria.
Since I have no previous experience with Cucumber or Maven I was not able to perform the remaining exercices in a short period of time.
